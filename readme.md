# üëæ BW8cpu

![BW8cpu Digital Simulation top level view](docs/assets/cpu_sim.png)

The BW8cpu is a homemade CPU built with discrete TTL logic chips on custom PCBs. It has a target clock rate of approximately 6 MHz, and is comparable to the Motorola 6809, and more specifically the Hitachi 6309, with its dual accumulators and additional dual general purpose registers.

A larger computer system is built around the CPU in the form of a full peripheral suite that allows the BW8cpu to function as a machine similar to the Commodore 64, Apple II, or NES. From a hardware perspective, the BW8cpu matches or maybe exceeds these systems in capability and usability in many regards. Its my hope that the system will eventually exceed its predecessors from a software perspective as well.

The project is originally inspired by Ben Eater's [8-bit breadboard CPU](https://eater.net/8bit) and his [breadboard MOS 6502 computer](https://eater.net/6502). However, ultimately the micro-architecture takes more cues from James Sharman's [8-bit pipelined CPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iHag4k4yEg&list=PLFhc0MFC8MiCDOh3cGFji3qQfXziB9yOw). This project would not be possible without the support of many individuals present on James' Discord server, notably [rj45](https://github.com/rj45/rj32), Quandary, Artentus, and [Louis Jewett](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsxBT-Jh5pMDU-uEN_EUXtg/featured).

This project is extremely ambitious and long running. This repository will maintain documentation and descriptions of the existent and planned features, as well as supporting schematics and source code files.

## Features

- 8-bit CPU with 16-bit addressing
- Up to 512 opcodes across 50+ instructions (CISC ISA)
- Dual 8-bit accumulators (A, B) accessible also as one 16-bit accumulator (E)
- Two additional 8-bit General Purpose Registers (C, D)
- Full 16-bit Stack Pointer (SP) and Program Counters (PC)
- Configurable Direct Page addressing (movable Zero Page)
- Two 16-bit Index Registers (X, Y)
- 32-function ALU with 4 flags (Carry, Zero, Overflow, Sign)
- Single IRQ source
- Partially configurable hardware memory map

## Architecture Overview

![architecture diagram of BW8cpu](docs/assets/arch_diagram.png)

- [von Neumann architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture) with shared program and data address space
- Vertical microcode (heavily encoded) with 32-bit Control Bus
- Direct to address bus assertions without MAR
