# ðŸ”§ ISA

The instruction set architecture is largely focused on ease of use, rather than performance. In some cases, having a specific address mode and instruction combination does increase performance. However, the hardware concessions that were made to enable an instruction set larger than 256 opcodes in size has introduced a small performance hit to approximately 2/3 of the entire instruction space. Efforts have been made to prioritize the most-commonly used opcodes in the 1/3 instruction space which is not affected by these concessions.

An accumulator-based micro architecture was adopted in order to alleviate instruction space concerns. As such, the A, B, or combined E accumulator acts as the destination register for most ALU-based instructions. Because the destination register is implied by the left-hand operand, the accumulator is also an operand for most ALU-based instructions.

There are a total of approximately 50 user-facing instructions, which are implemented via approximately 670 opcodes, which vary the operands and addressing mode of the core instructions.
