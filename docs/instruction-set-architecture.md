The BW8 has an 8-bit Instruction Register, so there is some trickery involved to support up to 512 opcodes, rather than just 256. This is done with the `EXT` instruction. This is a 1 byte, 1 cycle instruction which transitions the CPU from normal "`NRM`" mode to extended "`EXT`" mode, and then fetches the next instruction. This next instruction is interpretted differently due to the system being in `EXT` Mode. At the conclusion of these instructions, they return the CPU to `NRM` Mode. Through this mechanism, the CPU can ascribe two different meanings to each 8-bit opcode value, yielding a total of 512 opcodes.

The `NRM` Mode instructions are those which are commonly used, have long cycle counts, or have larger operand counts. The idea is to limit the cycle penalty incurred by `EXT` Mode opcodes to those which already execute quickly, or are not commonly used. In addition, by making sure that large operand count instructions exist in NRM Mode, we limit the maximum instruction size to 3 bytes, thereby keeping the program size penalty down.

# Programming Model

The CPU programming model includes four 8-bit General Purpose Registers (GPRs): `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and two 16-bit General Purpose Pointers (GPPs): `x`, `y`. There are four special purpose programmer facing registers:

1. `dp` - 8-bit, the location of the Direct Page
2. `ab` - 16-bit, a pseudo register constructed with `a` in the high byte and `b` in the low byte
3. `cd` - 16-bit, a psuedo register constructed with `c` in the high byte and `d` in the low byte
3. `sp` - 16-bit, the system Stack Pointer

These three registers have limited direct support, and are generally interacted with via `MOV`s. The `ab` and `cd` registers provide a mechanism for constructing 16-bit results that can be loaded into the GPPs or the SP. Additionally, there is the Status Register (`sr`) which stores the following CPU flags:

1. Zero (`Z`)
2. Carry (`C`)
3. Negative (`N`)
4. Overflow (`V`)
5. Interrupt Enable (`I`)

The first four of these are primarily set by the result of a recent ALU calculation. The final is used to enable or disable maskable interrupt requests (IRQ), and is managed directly by the programmer via `SEI` and `CLI`.

In the subsequent section, the size of an instruction is given as the total number of bytes required to execute the instruction. This includes the optional prefix `EXT` byte, and any operands following the opcode in the instruction stream.

# Addressing Modes

- *Implied*: There is no relevant operand source or destination, or they are implied directly by the opcode.

- *Register Direct*: There is no effective address; all operands are in registers which are implied by the opcode.

- *Immediate*: Their is no effective address; the operand is the one or two bytes following the opcode in the instruction stream, depending on the target of the instruction.

- *Absolute*: The effective address is given as a two-byte absolute address which follows the opcode in Big Endian order.

- *Direct*: The effective address is given as a one-byte direct page address which follows the opcode.

- *Register Indirect*: The effective address is the address in a pointer register implied by the opcode.

- *Indexed Indirect*: The effective address is computed by adding a signed 8-bit index to a pointer register's contents. Both the pointer register and the index source are implied in the opcode.

- *Relative*: The effective address is computed by adding a signed 8-bit offset to the Program Counter. The offset source is the byte following the opcode.

# Instruction Details

## `NOP` - No Operation

Field  | Value
------ | ---
Type   | `NRM`
Size   | 1
Cycles | 2
Mode   | Implied

    nop

Does nothing, and then continues.


## `BRK` - Break Clock

Field  | Value
------ | ---
Type   | `EXT`
Size   | 2
Cycles | 4
Mode   | Implied

    brk

The clock module which provides the CPU's clock input has three modes: Run, Demo, and Step. The final of which single steps the CPU. This opcode forces the clock mode into Step, and so it acts similarly to a `HLT` instruction, but is recoverable via the hardware clock control features. This instruction slightly breaks the encapsulation of the CPU's implementation details as it makes assumptions about hardware external to the CPU.

## `CLC` - Clear Carry

Cycles | 2
Mode   | Implied

| `Z` | `C` | `N` | `V` | `I`

    out <{port: u8}>, [{dp: u8}]
    out <{port: u8}>, #{imm: i8}

## `MOV` - Move Register

Field  | Value
------ | ---
Type   | `NRM`
Size   | 1
Cycles | 2
Mode   | Implied

The `MOV` instruction has both 8-bit and 16-bit versions. These versions have separate sets of allowed destinations and sources. The format of the `MOV` instruction is: `mov dst src`. It is illegal for `dst` to match `src`.

### 8-bit `MOV`

Source: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`
Destination: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`

Extraneous pairs:
    `mov a dp`
    `mov dp a`

### 16-bit `MOV`

Source: `x`, `y`, `ab`, `cd`
Destination: `x`, `y`, `ab`, `cd`

Extraneous pairs:
    `mov x sp`
    `mov sp x`

Note:
    `ab` and `cd` being used as a `src`-`dst` (or `dst`-`src`) pair is illegal. The assembler should implement these instructions as pseudo instructions consisting of two 8-bit `MOV`s.

## `LOAD` - Load Register

Field  | Value
------ | ---
Type   | `NRM`
Size   | varies
Cycles | varies
Mode   | varies

    load {dst: gpr}, [{dp: u8}]
    load {dst: gpr}, [{ptr: gpp | sp}, #{idx: s8}]
    load {dst: gpr}, [{ptr: gpp | sp}, {idx: gpr}]

Size: varies
Cycles: TBD

The *indexed indirect* 8-bit Load instructions allow for a GPR to be loaded with the value found at an address computed by adding an 8-bit value to a GPP or the SP. In all indirection sources, all 4 GPRs are valid index sources. When the indirection source is the `sp`, then an additional index source is allowed from the instruction stream, as an immediate offset.

### 16-bit `LOAD`

Destinations: GPPs
Addressing Modes:

**Immediate**

Size: 3
Cycles: TBD

**Absolute**

Size: 3

## `STORE` - Store Register

`STORE` instructions write a register's contents to memory. They are the reciprocal to the [`LOAD`](#load---load-register) instructions. They have identical modes and restrictions as the `LOAD` instructions do, with the exceptions that the **Immediate** mode does not exist, as that doesn't make sense in the context of a memory write, and the cycle counts may be different. Those are currently TBD.

## `LEA` - Load Effective Address

Field  | Value
------ | ---
Type   | `NRM`
Size   | 1
Cycles | TBD
Mode   | Indexed Indirect

Destinations: GPPs
Indirection Sources: GPPs or `sp`

The purpose of this instruction is to set the SR flags appropriately, and is commonly used before performing a conditional jump. They closely follow the Binary Math Operations rules, with the exception that immediates are not a supported right hand operand.

*TODO*: Compare with Immediates are very useful. Add these in once `LSR` instructions have been removed.

## `WAI` - Wait for Interrupt

Field  | Value
------ | ---
Type   | `NRM`
Size   | 1
Cycles | varies
Mode   | Implied

The `WAI` instruction causes execution to suspend until an IRQ is received. This instruction has two distinct behaviors, depending on the state of the SR's `I` flag prior to it beginning execution.

- `I = 0`: When an IRQ is received, a context shift to the appropriate ISR occurs. When the routine returns, execution resumes after the `WAI` instruction.

- `I = 1`: When an IRQ is recieved, no context shift occurs and execution continues after the `WAI` instruction. This can be used to process interrupts "in-line".

## `RTI` - Return from Interrupt

Field  | Value
------ | ---
Type   | `NRM`
Size   | 1
Cycles | TBD
Mode   | Implied

The `RTI` instruction performs a context switch away from an ISR to the previously executing code by restoring the Program Counter, the Status Register, and the Interrupt Inhibit flag.

# Binary Math Operations

Binary Math Instructions are Arithmetic or Logical instructions which have two operands. In the BW8 ISA, these include the following:

1. `ADC`
2. `SBB`
3. `AND`
4. `OR`
5. `XOR`

These instructions have left and right hand side operands. The left hand operand also serves as the destination of the result. The left hand side operand is referred to as the destination, and the right hand side operand is referred to as the source: `bin_op dst src`.

Destinations: GPRs or Direct Page location
Sources: GPRs, Direct Page location, or immediate value

- When `dst` and `src` are both GPRs, they are allowed to be identical. Left shifts are supported via this mechanism.
- Both the `dst` and `src` may not be Direct Page locations.

Binary Math Instructions which are 3 bytes in size - this occurs when `dst` is a Direct Page location and `src` is an immediate value - are of the `NRM` type. Otherwise, they are of the `EXT` type.

# Unary Math Operations

Unary Math Operations are Arithmetic and Logical instructions which have one operand. In the BW8 ISA, these include the following:

1. `NOT`
2. `NEG`
3. `LSR`
4. `LRC`
5. `ASR`

These instructions have a single operand, which is used as both the source and the destination: `uny_op src`. The source is either a GPR, or a Direct Page location.

Addressing Modes:

**Implied**

Size: 2
Cycles: TBD

**Direct Page**

Size: 3
Cycles: TBD

All Unary Math Operations are of the `EXT` type.

# Jump Operations

Field | Value
--- | ---
Type | varies
Size | varies
Cycles | varies
Mode | varies

Jump instructions shift the execution path by moving the source into the Program Counter. This jump may be performed conditionally, based on the value of specific flags in the Status Register, or unconditionally. The source of the new execution point comes from the Addressing Mode. All jumps in the BW8 ISA support the same Addressing Modes. The mode also informs the type and size of the instruction.

Addressing Modes:

**Absolute**

Type: `NRM`
Size: 3
Cycles: TBD

**Relative**

Type: `NRM`
Size: 2
Cycles: TBD

**Indirect**

Indirection Sources: GPPs
Type: `EXT`
Size: 2
Cycles: TBD
