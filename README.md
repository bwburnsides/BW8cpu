# Apple Pie

An 8-bit processor and peripherials from the fundamentals.

    If you wish to make apple pie from scratch, you must first create the universe.

My project is inspired by Ben Eater's [8 bit breadboard computer](https://eater.net/8bit), and his follow-on series with the [8502 processor](https://eater.net/6502) and a home-built [VGA video card](https://eater.net/vga). I hope to bridge the gap between these series by developing a CPU that is similar enough in capability to the 8502, that the video card and other peripherials (ie, PS/2 keyboard) can directly interface with the device.
