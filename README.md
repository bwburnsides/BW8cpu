# 👾 BW8cpu

The BW8cpu is a homemade CPU built with discrete TTL logic chips on custom designed PCBs. It has a target clock rate of approximately 6 MHz, and is comparable to the Motorola 6809, and more specifically the Hitachi 6309. A larger computer system is built around the CPU in the form a full peripheral suite that allows the BW8cpu to perform as an integrated computer similar to the Commodore 64 and NES. From a hardware perspective, the BW8cpu exceeds these systems in capability and usability in most regards. Its my hope that the system will eventually exceed its predecessors from a software perspective as well.

The project is originally inspired by Ben Eater's [8-bit breadboard CPU](https://eater.net/8bit) and his [breadboard MOS 6502 computer](https://eater.net/6502). However, ultimately the micro-architecture takes more cues from James Sharman's [8-bit pipelined CPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iHag4k4yEg&list=PLFhc0MFC8MiCDOh3cGFji3qQfXziB9yOw). This project would not be possible without the support of many individuals present on James Sharman's Discord server, notably [rj45](https://github.com/rj45/rj32), Quandary, Artentus, and [Louis Jewett](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsxBT-Jh5pMDU-uEN_EUXtg/featured).

This project is extremely ambitious and long running. This repository will maintain documentation and descriptions of the existent and planned features, as well as supporting schematics and source code files.
